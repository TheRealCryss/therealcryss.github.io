                <p>Origins:</p>
<p>During the last few month when playing FROST and Horizon I've always wondered what this or that building's story was and how nice it would be to enter them and if one even offered a little shelter and hideout during a rad storm. But how? There wasn't any content there to be entered. It had to be build!</p>
<p>There are a lot of other good mods out there that do the job, but I wanted my own and because I had a creative impetus recently on the Horizon Discord where one fellow wastelanders asked what the requirements were for the new reclaimation site and how to keep track of it. So I spontaniously started a spreadsheet. And the impetus lasted longer than this. Thankfully.</p>
<p>So I did a field trip ingame and while testing Horizon 1.9 alpha I was also feeding my <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nog9hw8JB3lVprp3YwPJIerMBO3vsZsL0VhQS6Wvu_o/edit#gid=0" title="List of ressource and perk requirements for the Horizon 1.9 reclaim system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prospector's Guide to the Wastelands,</a> looking for nice place to explore and took notes and pictures. A lot!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To increase immersion when doing a Horizon winter playthrough and restrict myself to only grow crops in my greenhouses I was frustrated by the fact, that all crops I place are snow covered. So I made this patch. It is my second mod now and I hope everything is working for you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note:<br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I'm still earning to use CK and Xedit I couldn't find a smarter way of "restoring" the non-snow textures for specific items by just excluding them from the overwriting snow texture mod (I'm using Fallout 4 Seasons) I made a subfolder with renamed vanilla textures and bgms that I selected for every <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/17374" title="Fallout 4 Horizon Mod - Complete Overhaul" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Horizon</a> specific item like the automatic planters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the first release and therefore there may be some inconsistencies or items that I have overlooked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/30396610?tab=user+files" title="Greb's Nexus Mods site for Fallout 4 patches" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greb</a> for the critical bugfix that was in my first release (0.5). (I better double check what CK does in the future. Lesson learned!). Get this version 1.0!</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements:</span></p>

<li>Horizon 1.8</li>
